# Mercury Delay Memory Circuit Simulation
A circuit simulation of mercury delay line computer memory using LTSpice.  To simulate mercury ultrasonic memory, a transmission line is used which introduces a delayed signal.  The memory is a space of two addresses, each address is 1 byte.  The supporting circuit cycles the signals and outputs the value of address1 and address2 on two separate lines.
